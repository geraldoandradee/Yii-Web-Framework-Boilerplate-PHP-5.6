# Yii Web Framework Boilerplate


This is my setup for PHP 5.6 projects. The guest machine is a Centos 6.5 really stable. 


## REQUIREMENTS

You need VirtualBox and Vagrant previously installed.
 

## HOW TO RUN

Run command bellow:

    vagrant up   

An important detail is make your hosts file point to ip defined in Vagrantfile, so in your hosts:

    192.168.33.25	yiiboilerplate.com

## DATABASE

You can initialise your database putting your data in <project root>/manifests/database/setup.sql


### MYSQL PASSWORD

The default root password for mysql is 'root'.


## Directory structure
    
As you can see:

* application: Yii application itself
* manifests: configuration files for web application;
* www: public folder;
* vendor: generated by composer.


# Advanced Use

You can change any file in manifests directory to change domain, database setup and so on. Just check it out.


# What's next?

In future i want to create a vagrant box with more flexible installers not only for PHP 5.6 but also for other versions.
